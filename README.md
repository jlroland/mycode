# My Python Basics Repo

This repository is being set up as part of my Python course work.  Though I've learned Python previously and have used GitHub before, it's been some time since I've used these skills, so I'm practicing here.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project
on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Authors

* **Jessica Roland** - [My GitHub Page](https://github.com/jlroland)
