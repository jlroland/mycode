# My Python Basics Repo

This repository is being set up as part of my Python course work.  Though I've learned Python previously and have used GitHub before, it's been some time since I've used these skills, so I'm practicing here.

## Getting Started
I started by cloning this repo to my virtual machine.

### Prerequisites

What things are needed to install the software and how to install them. For now, maybe copy in
"how to install python and python3 using apt."

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The coding language used

## Authors

* **Jessica Roland** - [My GitHub Page](https://github.com/jlroland)
